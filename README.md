## Why

I worked on this project for two main reasons:
  1.) My friend kept reusing the same password and wanted a way to create new ones without thinking
  2.) It sounded like a fun project
  
## What Did I Learn

  1.) How to manipulate strings in Java
  2.) Refreshed on how to work with the WindowBuilder 
 
## Things I Will Add

  1.) More customization options for passwords
  2.) Better Error Handling
  3.) A way to check that the password has not been generated in the last 10 cycles
